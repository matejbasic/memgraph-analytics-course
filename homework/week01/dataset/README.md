# Dataset


`processed_recipes.pickle` was created from two different datasets using `generate.py`:
1. https://dominikschmidt.xyz/simplified-recipes-1M/
    - source for list of ingredients, processed and simplified
    
2. https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes
    - list of recipes
   
and it's a list od Recipe dataclasses (see `schema.py`).
